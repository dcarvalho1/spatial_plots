Web Interface
=============

To use this interface, copy the tarball to a web server (e.g. your personal space on the GMAO intranet) and extract it.  

To populate the database, copy and untar the tarballs created by this package in the spatial_data subdirectory.  the main page (index.php) will automatically populate itself based on the directory structure within the tarball.
