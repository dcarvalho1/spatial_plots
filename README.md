# spatial_plots
Clean distribution of GMAO/WM spatial plot program.  

To compile, ensure that the ESMADIR in the file esmadir.config is pointing to a recent build, and execute the script
* ./compile.csh

This script is set up this way because I am no good at making makefiles.

To clean up,
* ./compile.csh clean
